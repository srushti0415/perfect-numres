    <h1>Sherlock Holmes. </h1>
<h2>A Study In Scarlet</h2>
<p>I
    n the year 1878 I took my degree of
    Doctor of Medicine of the University of
    London, and proceeded to Netley to go
    through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies
    there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment
    was stationed in India at the time, and before I
    could join it, the second Afghan war had broken
    out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps
    had advanced through the passes, and was already
    deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however,
    with many other officers who were in the same
    situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at
    once entered upon my new duties.
    The campaign brought honours and promotion
    to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune
    and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
    attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at
    the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on
    the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the
    bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should
    have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis
    had it not been for the devotion and courage shown
    by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a
    pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to
    the British lines.
    Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged
    hardships which I had undergone, I was removed,
    with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base
    hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about
    the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that
    curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life
    was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself
    and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day
    should be lost in sending me back to England. I was
    dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes,
    and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with
    my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission
    from a paternal government to spend the next nine
    months in attempting to improve it.
    I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was
    therefore as free as air—or as free as an income
    of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit
    a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into
    which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are</p>
